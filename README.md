## Picar-X with Google Coral Dev Board

This fork is still under development and not ready for deployment. We aim to make the Picar-X software to be fully compatible with the [Google Coral Dev Board] (https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started/). Currently we use th v2.0 branch as default developing branch for the picar-x.
